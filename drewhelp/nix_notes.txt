    !$ is the last argument to the previous command. !$ is shorthand for !!:$

!$ - Use the last argument only from `!!`
!:2 - Use the 2nd argument (0th index = command)
!:1-$ - Use all the parameters.  E.g. you issued a command with 10 parameters but misspelled the command itself, use `correct-command !:1-$`
!str - Use the most recent command that matches the string.  Useful with :p (e.g. `!vpn:p`) to ensure it is the desired instruction.

...

History File Manipulation:
history -w will save your current history to the file.  Otherwise only happens on successful/normal logout.  Useful for SSH.
history -c will clear the entire history.  Use with `-w` to save the empty file
history -d 252 will delete line 252 from history.  Good if you accidentally issues a command with credentials.



_Eric's notes_

# History #

System Aliases/Overrides:
_history : default `history` reference
history : override function.  If no variables, displays `_history`.  Otherwise performs `history | grep "$@"`.
hs : alias for custom history

Useful Examples:
history - Display history
history keyword - grep for keyword over history results
! - Indicator for a "history expansion"
!! - Execute previous history entry.  Can be used in another command, e.g. you forgot to sudo: `sudo !!`
!!:p - Print previous history entry to shell (no execute)
!252 - Execute command in history position 252

!$ - Use the last argument only from `!!`
!:2 - Use the 2nd argument (0th index = command)
!:1-$ - Use all the parameters.  E.g. you issued a command with 10 parameters but misspelled the command itself, use `correct-command !:1-$`
!str - Use the most recent command that matches the string.  Useful with :p (e.g. `!vpn:p`) to ensure it is the desired instruction.

Items with * next to it in entry are edited.

Useful examples:
$> cat ~/code/externalapps/dwm/dwm.c
$> cd !$:h
$> # cd ~/code/externalapps/dwm/

$> cp /some/directory/here/original.txt !#:1.bak
$> # cp /some/directory/here/original.txt /some/directory/here/original.txt.bak
